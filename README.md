# Image-Classification-CIFAR10
The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. I've preprocessed these images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. At the end, the neural network's predictions on the sample images is shown.
*This project does not use the CNN Tensorflow libraries but uses it's Neural net libraries, and is aimed at understanding the basics of the convolutional layers from ground up.*
