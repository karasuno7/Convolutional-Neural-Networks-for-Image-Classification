# Image-Classification-CIFAR10
The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.At the end, we'll get to see the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
*This project does not use the Tensorflow libraries, and is aimed at understanding the basics of the convolutional layers from ground up.*
